Implementation for Practical course: Recent advances in model checking

## Prior installation required
### Momba (from momba repo)

Momba is available from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/):
```sh
pip install momba[all]
```
Installing Momba with the `all` feature flag will install all optional dependencies unleashing the full power and all features of Momba.
Check out the [examples](https://koehlma.github.io/momba/examples) or read the [user guide](https://koehlma.github.io/momba/guide) to learn more.

If you aim at a fully reproducible modeling environment, we recommend using [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
We also provide a [GitHub Template](https://github.com/koehlma/momba-pipenv-template) for Pipenv.
